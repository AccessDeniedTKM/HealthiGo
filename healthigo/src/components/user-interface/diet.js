    Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life-course helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and
    conditions. However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are
    now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such
    as whole grains.

    The exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of
    physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs. However, the basic principles of what constitutes a healthy diet remain
    the same.

    Home remedies to keep you super fit!
    </h3>
    <p>
    Experts share home remedies that help them stay fit.
    </p>
    <p>Seafood for ageless skin
        Eating fish three times a week cuts wrinkling and sagging by 30 per cent, as seafood is rich in protein, minerals and omega-3 fats — nutrients that nourish
         the collagen and muscles that keep skin smooth. Salmon, for one, is also rich in astaxanthin — an antioxidant that reduces fine lines and wrinkling.

    Green tea to beat stress Green tea has compounds that help your brain use blood sugar for fuel and stimulate the production of energising hormones called
    endorphins. So the next time you’re feeling sapped of energy, docs say, sip on green tea.

    Walnuts for a strong heart
        Cardiologists recommend eating five to six walnuts daily to cut your risk of a heart attack by half and add almost three healthy years to your life.
        Turns out these crunchy treats are one of the richest natural sources of artery-healing monounsaturated fats.

    <h3> Common dieting errors we all make but shouldn't! </h3>
    <p>
    Many people makes these common mistakes when they’re trying to lose weight. Don’t be one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Most people, when they embark on a diet, are gungho and all geared up to do whatever it takes to shed those pounds. But within just a few days, lose the
    initiative and go back to old habits. So where exactly are you going wrong? Are you making the same mistakes every time? Here are some common blunders
    that could be standing in your way...
    </p>
    <p>
    Do you skip meals thinking that you will lose weight? That is your biggest blunder. Missing a meal backfires because you end up eating more the next time
    and your body ends up storing fat when it goes hungry. So eat small meals often instead of three large meals.
